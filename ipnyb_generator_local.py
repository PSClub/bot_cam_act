This notebook contains the complete code for the `bot_cam_act` repository. 
The cells are ordered logically to allow for inspection and execution.

**Instructions:**
1.  Run the `pip install` cell to install all required packages.
2.  Run the subsequent code cells in order.
3.  The final `main.py` cell has been modified. It now has an `await main()` call at the end, which will start the process.
4.  The browser session from Playwright is returned and assigned to a `browser` variable. You can interact with it after the script runs.
5.  A final, separate cell `await browser.close()` is provided to manually close the browser when you are finished with your debugging.
